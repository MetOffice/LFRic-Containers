## Recipes

#### Singularity-GCC-VisTools-MINT

This container provides a complete LFRic build environment based on the GNU compilers, along with a "headless" version of ParaView (only ParaView Server and ParaView Python), the MINT regridding library, as well as additional tools such as Iris (scitools.org.uk/iris) and essential Python packages. It also includes Rose and FCM for building LFRic with UM sources.
